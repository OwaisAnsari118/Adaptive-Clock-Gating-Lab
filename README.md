# Adaptive Clock Gating Lab

Welcome to my personal R&D repository on **Adaptive Clock Gating**.

This repo contains:
- ðŸ“š Detailed notes & diagrams on clock gating techniques
- ðŸ’» Safe, reusable Verilog/SystemVerilog examples
- ðŸ“Š Power/toggle analysis experiments
- ðŸ›  Scripts for automation & synthesis

## Topics Covered
- Static vs. Dynamic vs. Adaptive Clock Gating
- Coarse vs. Fine-grained Gating
- Manual vs. Automatic Gating
- ASIC (ICG cells) vs. FPGA (CE signals) Implementations

## Project Goals
1. Build a public knowledge base for engineers
2. Share educational examples without revealing customer IP
3. Experiment with synthesis flows for better gating efficiency

## Folder Guide
- `docs/` â†’ Knowledge base & notes
